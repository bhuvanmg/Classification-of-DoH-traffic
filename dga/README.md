## DOMAIN GENERATION ALGORITHMS 

### SETUP :

Install python requirements: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run dns_query.bat file 

Resolver server ip and port can ve changed in dns_query.py 
It uses default localhost port 45 to differentiate normal dns traffic and dga traffic.
dns proxy must be run in the same port.

We used the following 10 algorithms :

- banjori
- fobber
- fosniw
- murofet
- mydoom
- necurs
- orchard
- qadars
- qakbot
- tinba
