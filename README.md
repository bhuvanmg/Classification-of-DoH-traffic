# Generation and Classification of DGA and DNS Tunneling Traffic

This project focuses on simulating, capturing, and analyzing Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) and DNS tunneling traffic. It provides a framework to study malicious DNS traffic patterns and train models or tools for classification and detection.

## üìå Objectives

- Generate DNS tunneling traffic using various tools.
- Simulate DGA traffic patterns.
- Capture and analyze DNS queries and responses.
- Classify DGA vs. DNS tunneling traffic.
