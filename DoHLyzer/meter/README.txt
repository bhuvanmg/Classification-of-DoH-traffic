The DoH-Tunnel-Traffic-HKD dataset

The dataset contains PCAP files of DoH tunnel traffic generated by dnstt [1], tcp-over-dns [2], and tuns [3].
The dataset includes CSV files of statistical traffic features extracted from PCAP files by DoHlyzer [4].
The "Total-48h-Augmentation.csv" encloses traffic flows of dnstt 46080, tcp-over-dns 30040, tuns 29040, augmented assuming 20 client PCs.
